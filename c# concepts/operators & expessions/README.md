## C# operators and expressions

### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| - | Subtracts second operand from the first | A - B = -10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands | A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator | B / A = 2 |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases integer value by one | A++ = 11 |
| -- | Decrement operator decreases integer value by one | A-- = 9 |

### Relational Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true. |
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. | (A != B) is true. |
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A > B) is not true. |
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A < B) is true. |
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true. |
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A <= B) is true. |

### Boolean logical operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&&` | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true. | (A && B) is false. |
| `ll` | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true. | (A ll B) is true. |
| `!` | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false. | !(A && B) is true. |
| `^` | Logical exclusive OR operator.  | t ^ t = f, t ^ f = t, f ^ t = t, f ^ f = f |


### Bitwise operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation. The truth tables for `&`, `|`, and `^` are as follows:

| p | q | p & q | p l q | p ^ q |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; then in the binary format they are as follows âˆ’

A = 0011 1100

B = 0000 1101

A&B = 0000 1100

A|B = 0011 1101

A^B = 0011 0001

~A  = 1100 0011

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| & | Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands. | (A & B) = 12, which is 0000 1100 |
| | | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand. | (A | B) = 61, which is 0011 1101 |
| ^ | Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. | (A ^ B) = 49, which is 0011 0001 |
| ~ | Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits. | (~A ) = -61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement due to a signed binary number. |
| << | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | A << 2 = 240, which is 1111 0000 |
| >> | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | A >> 2 = 15, which is 0000 1111 |
