## C# operators and expressions

### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| - | Subtracts second operand from the first | A - B = -10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands | A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator | B / A = 2 |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases integer value by one | A++ = 11 |
| -- | Decrement operator decreases integer value by one | A-- = 9 |

### Relational Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true. |
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. | (A != B) is true. |
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A > B) is not true. |
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A < B) is true. |
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true. |
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A <= B) is true. |

### Boolean logical operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true. | (A && B) is false. |
| || | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true. | (A || B) is true. |
| ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false. | !(A && B) is true. |
| ^ | Logical exclusive OR operator.  | t ^ t = f, t ^ f = t, f ^ t = t, f ^ f = f |
