## Method

Syntax
```
<Access Specifier> <Return Type> <Method Name> (Parameter List) {
    //...statement...
}
```

> Methods and Functions are the same in C#.                                                                                   However, Methods are used in C# and are functions that operate through a designated class. A method is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C# program has at least one class with a method named **Main**.
