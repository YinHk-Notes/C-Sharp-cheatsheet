## Namespace

### Why using namespace?
- namespaces used to organize its many classes.
- declaring your own namespaces can help you **control the scope of class and method** names in larger programming projects.

### Namespaces have the following properties:

- They organize large code projects.
- They're delimited by using the `.` operator.
- The using directive obviates the requirement to specify the name of the namespace for every class.
- The global namespace is the "root" namespace: global`::`System will always refer to the .NET System namespace.



The namespace keyword is used to declare a scope. The ability to create scopes within your project helps organise code and lets you create globally-unique types.
