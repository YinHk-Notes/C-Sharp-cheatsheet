## `in`, `out` & `ref` difference

Used as parameter modifier

All **must be passed by reference**


- **`in`** : the parameter passed cannot be modified by the method + must be initialized before being passed in a method call

- **`out`** : the parameter passed can be changed in the method + not required to be initialized before being passed in a method call

- **`ref`** : the parameter passed can be changed in the method + must be initialized before being passed in a method call
