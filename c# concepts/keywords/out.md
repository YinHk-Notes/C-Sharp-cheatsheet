## out(parameter modifier)

`out` allows you to pass parameters using **references** and to **change the values** of those parameters as well.

`out` keyword is used to pass arguments to method as a **reference type**.

`out` is used to state that the **parameter** passed **must be modified by the method**.



You can use the out keyword in two contexts:
- As a **parameter modifier**, which lets you pass an argument to a method **by reference** rather than by **value**.
- In **generic type parameter** declarations for **interfaces** and **delegates**, which specifies that a **type** parameter is **covariant**.


> The `out` keyword is identical to the `ref` keyword, with the exception that `ref` needs the variable to be initialized prior to being passed. It is similar to `ref` keyword. But the main difference between `ref` and `out` keyword is that ref needs that the variable must be initialized before it passed to the method. But out parameter doesnâ€™t require the variables to be initialized before it passed to the method.

-   In c#, `out` keyword is used to pass arguments to the method as a **reference type**.
-   It is also similar to the in keyword but the _in_ keyword does not allow the method that called to change the argument value but `ref` allows.
-   For using _out_ keyword as a parameter both the method definition and calling method must use the _out_ keyword explicitly.
-   The out parameters are not allowed to use in asynchronous methods.
-   The out parameters are not allowed to use in iterator methods.
-   There can be more than one out parameter in a method.
-   At the time of method call, out parameter can be declared inline. But the inline out parameters can be accessed in the same block of code where it calls.
-   Method overloading can also be done using out parameters.
-   Properties cannot be passed as out parameters as these are not variables.
-   Up to C# 6.0, a user first declares the variable then it can only pass as an out argument. But from C# 7.0, excepting a separate variable declaration, the user can also declare the out variable in the argument list of the method call.

```cs
// No need to initialize 
// the variable here
data_type variable_name;

Method_Name(out variable_name);

// you can also convert both above two 
// lines of codes as follows from
//  C# 7.0 onwards
Method_Name(out data_type variable_name);
```




>  When working with the out keyword in C#, both the method signature and the calling method **must explicitly specify the `out` keyword**.

Eg:
```cs
int number;
OutDemo(out number);
Console.WriteLine(number); //The value is now 100
void OutDemo(out int number)
{
    number = 100;
}
```



```cs
// Main method
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // Declaring variable
        // without assigning value
        int i;
 
        // Pass variable i to the method
        // using out keyword
        Addition(out i);
 
        // Display the value i
        Console.WriteLine("The addition of the value is: {0}", i);
    }
 
    // Method in which out parameter is passed
    // and this method returns the value of
    // the passed parameter
    public static void Addition(out int i)
    {
        i = 30;
        i += i;
    }
}
```
