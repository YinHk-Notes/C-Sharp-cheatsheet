## params
A method in C# defines a number of arguments and their types in the method declaration.

When a method is called, it expects the same number and types of the arguments passed by the caller code, unless there are optional parameters.



In C#, `params` is a keyword which is used to specify a parameter that takes variable number of arguments.
