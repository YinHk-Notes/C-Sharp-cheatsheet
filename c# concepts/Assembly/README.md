### Assembly
`.NET` **assemblies** are collections of compiled types (classes and other types) and resources.

- Assemblies are the fundamental units of deployment, version control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions for .NET-based applications.
- It is basically a compiled code that can be executed by the CLR.
- An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. 
- An assembly is a file that is automatically generated by the compiler upon successful compilation of every .NET application.
- An Assembly contains Intermediate Language (IL) code, which is similar to Java byte code.
- It can be either a Dynamic Link Library or an executable file.
- It is generated only once for an application and upon each subsequent compilation the assembly gets updated. 
- The entire process will run in the background of your application
- There is no need for you to learn deeply about assemblies.
- Assembly is the smallest unit of deployment of a .net application. It can be a dll or an exe.
There are mainly two types to it:
  1. **Private Assembly**: The dll or exe which is sole property of one application only. It is generally stored in application root folder
  2. **Public/Shared assembly**: It is a dll which can be used by multiple applications at a time. A shared assembly is stored in GAC i.e Global Assembly Cache.
