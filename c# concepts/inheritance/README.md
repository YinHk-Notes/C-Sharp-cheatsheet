## inheritance
It is possible to **inherit fields and methods** from one class to another. We group the 

"inheritance concept" into two categories:

- **Derived Class** (child) -  the class that inherits from another class
- **Base Class** (parent)   -  the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the " **:** " symbol.

```
ðŸ“Œ Derived Class : Base Class
