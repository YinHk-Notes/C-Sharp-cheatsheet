## Static

- **static** Classes
- **static** Class Members

> üìå `static` means **not unique**




- Use the `static` modifier to declare a `static` member,  which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object. 
- `static` **cannot be instantiated**. 
- The `static` modifier can be used with **classes**, **fields**, **methods**, **properties**, **operators**, **events**, and **constructors**. 
- A **non-static class** can contain `static` **methods**, **fields**, **properties**, or **events**. 
- `static` class **should have `static` member only**, a `static` class can only contain `static` data members, `static` methods, and a `static` constructor. It is **not allowed to create objects of the static class**.  
- `static` class **cannot be instantiated** [create objects of the static class], and **cannot inherit a `static` class from another class**.
- It is more typical to declare a **non-static class** with some `static` members, than to declare an entire class as `static`. Two common uses of **static fields** are to **keep a count of the number** of objects that have been instantiated, or to **store a value that must be shared among all instances**.

- `static` methods can be **overloaded** but **not overridden**, because they **belong to the class**, and not to any instance of the class. - `static` method are shared by all objects of the class, one copy for all objects. 
- A **static method**, which means that it **can be directly accessed without creating an object of the class**, unlike **public**, **which can only be accessed by objects**.

- `static` methods and properties **cannot access non-static fields and events** in their containing type, and they cannot access an instance variable of any object unless it's explicitly passed in a method parameter.

Although a field cannot be declared as **`static` const**, a [const](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/const) field is essentially static in its behavior. It belongs to the type, not to instances of the type. Therefore, const fields can be accessed by using the same `ClassName.MemberName` notation that's used for `static` fields. No object instance is required.
