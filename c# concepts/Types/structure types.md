## Structure types
A structure type (or struct type) is a value type that can encapsulate data and related functionality. It can contain a parameterized constructor, static constructor, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events, and nested types.

```cs
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

Coordinate point = new Coordinate();
```
