## Anonymous types

Anonymous types provide a convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without having to explicitly define a type first. 

In C#, an anonymous type is a type (class) without any name that can contain **public read-only properties** only. It **cannot contain other members**, such as **fiel**ds, **methods**, **events**, etc.

The type name is generated by the compiler and is not available at the source code level.
 
```cs
var v = new { Amount = 108, Message = "Hello" };

// Rest the mouse pointer over v.Amount and v.Message in the following
// statement to verify that their inferred types are int and string.
Console.WriteLine(v.Amount + v.Message);
```

```cs
var productQuery =
    from prod in products
    select new { prod.Color, prod.Price };

foreach (var v in productQuery)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Color={0}, Price={1}", v.Color, v.Price);
}
```

```cs
var student = new { Id = 1, FirstName = "James", LastName = "Bond" };
Console.WriteLine(student.Id); //output: 1
Console.WriteLine(student.FirstName); //output: James
Console.WriteLine(student.LastName); //output: Bond
```

```cs
var student = new { 
                    Id = 1, 
                    FirstName = "James", 
                    LastName = "Bond",
                    Address = new { Id = 1, City = "London", Country = "UK" }
                };
```

You can create an array of anonymous types also.
```cs
var students = new[] {
            new { Id = 1, FirstName = "James", LastName = "Bond" },
            new { Id = 2, FirstName = "Steve", LastName = "Jobs" },
            new { Id = 3, FirstName = "Bill", LastName = "Gates" }
    };

```
