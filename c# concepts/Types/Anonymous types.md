## Anonymous types

Anonymous types provide a convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without having to explicitly define a type first

The type name is generated by the compiler and is not available at the source code level.
 
```cs
var v = new { Amount = 108, Message = "Hello" };

// Rest the mouse pointer over v.Amount and v.Message in the following
// statement to verify that their inferred types are int and string.
Console.WriteLine(v.Amount + v.Message);
```

```cs
var productQuery =
    from prod in products
    select new { prod.Color, prod.Price };

foreach (var v in productQuery)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Color={0}, Price={1}", v.Color, v.Price);
}
```
