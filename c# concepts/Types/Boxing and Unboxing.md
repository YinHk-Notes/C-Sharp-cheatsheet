## Boxing and Unboxing
Value type stores the value itself, whereas the reference type stores the address of the value where it is stored. 
Sometimes you often need to convert value types to reference types or vice-versa. reference types stored on heap where it contains the address of the value and value type is just an actual value stored on the stack.

convert them from one type to another, this conversion processes are called **boxing and unboxing**.

### Boxing
the process of converting a VALUE type to reference type.

### Unboxing 
Unboxing is the reverse of boxing. the process of converting a reference type to value type. Unboxing extract the value from the reference type and assign it to a value type.
