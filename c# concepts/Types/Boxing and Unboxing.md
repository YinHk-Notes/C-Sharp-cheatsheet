Value type stores the value itself, whereas the reference type stores the address of the value where it is stored. 
Sometimes you often need to convert value types to reference types or vice-versa. reference types stored on heap where it contains the address of the value and value type is just an actual value stored on the stack.

convert them from one type to another, this conversion processes are called **boxing and unboxing**.
