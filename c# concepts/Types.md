## Types

The variables in C#, are categorized into the following types: 

- **Value Types**
    
    **eg:** 
    ```csharp
    byte num = 0xA;
    
    int i = 5;
    
    char c = 'Z';
    ```
    
    > **structs** are also value types
    
   
- **Reference Types**
    
    A type that is defined as a [class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class), [delegate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate), array, or [interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface) is a ***reference type***
    

### **C# Type Casting**

Type casting is when you assign a value of one data type to another [type.In](http://type.in/) C#, there are two types of casting:

- **Implicit Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size char → int → long → float → double
- **Explicit Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type. Explicit casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value double → float → long → int → char
