## Attributes

Attributes provide a powerful method of associating metadata, or declarative information, with code (assemblies, types, methods, properties, and so forth). After an attribute is associated with a program entity, the attribute can be queried at run time by using a technique called _reflection_.

Attributes have the following properties:

-   Attributes add metadata to your program. _Metadata_ is information about the types defined in a program. All .NET assemblies contain a specified set of metadata that describes the types and type members defined in the assembly. You can add custom attributes to specify any additional information that is required.
-   You can apply one or more attributes to entire assemblies, modules, or smaller program elements such as classes and properties.
-   Attributes can accept arguments in the same way as methods and properties.
-   Your program can examine its own metadata or the metadata in other programs by using reflection.
