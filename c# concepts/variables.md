## Variable

### declare variable:

syntax:
```
type variable_name
```

- Naming should be in camel case.
- variable can be  declared without initialize its value immediately
- variables with same type can be declared in same line by using comma to seperate them eg:
    
 ```cs
    int a,b;
    int var1,var2=2,var3;
 ```
