## Generic
**Generics** allow you to define the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, **generics** **allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type**.

Generics in C# is its most powerful feature. It allows you to define the type-safe data structures.

C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the **type parameter** and **without the specific data type**.

Generic means the **general form, not specific**. In C#, generic means not specific to a particular data type.

C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the type parameter and without the specific data type.

A type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type.

A generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name, e.g. `TypeName<T>` where `T` is a type parameter.
