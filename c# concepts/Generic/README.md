## Generic
**Generics** allow you to define the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, **generics** allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type.

Generics in C# is its most powerful feature. It allows you to define the type-safe data structures.

C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the **type parameter** and **without the specific data type**.
