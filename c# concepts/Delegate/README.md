## Delegate

if we want to **pass a function as a parameter**? How does C# handles the callback functions or event handler? The answer is - **"delegate"**.

A **delegate** is a **type** that represents **references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type**. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance with any method with a compatible signature and return type. You can invoke (or call) the method through the delegate instance.
