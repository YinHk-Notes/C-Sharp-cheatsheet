### Documentation comments (XML format) for C#
C# provides a mechanism for programmers to document their code using a comment syntax that contains XML text. In source code files, comments having a certain form can be used to direct a tool to produce XML from those comments and the source code elements, which they precede. Comments using such syntax are called documentation comments.
