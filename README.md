### Documentation comments (XML format) for C# (similar to Javadoc and JDoc)
C# provides a mechanism for programmers to document their code using a comment syntax that contains XML text. In source code files, comments having a certain form can be used to direct a tool to produce XML from those comments and the source code elements, which they precede. Comments using such syntax are called documentation comments. 

C# source files can have structured comments that produce API documentation for the types defined in those files.
