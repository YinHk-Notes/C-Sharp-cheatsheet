## String's method



| Method Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Clone() | It is used to return a reference to this instance of String. |
| Compare(String, String) | It is used to compares two specified String objects. It returns an integer that indicates their relative position in the sort order. |
| CompareOrdinal(String, String) | It is used to compare two specified String objects by evaluating the numeric values of the corresponding Char objects in each string.. |
| CompareTo(String) | It is used to compare this instance with a specified String object. It indicates whether this instance precedes, follows, or appears in the same position in the sort order as the specified string. |
| Concat(String, String) | It is used to concatenate two specified instances of String. |
| Contains(String) | It is used to return a value indicating whether a specified substring occurs within this string. |
| Copy(String) | It is used to create a new instance of String with the same value as a specified String. |
| CopyTo(Int32, Char[], Int32, Int32) | It is used to copy a specified number of characters from a specified position in this instance to a specified position in an array of Unicode characters. |
| EndsWith(String) | It is used to check that the end of this string instance matches the specified string. |
| Equals(String, String) | It is used to determine that two specified String objects have the same value. |
| Format(String, Object) | It is used to replace one or more format items in a specified string with the string representation of a specified object. |
| GetEnumerator() | It is used to retrieve an object that can iterate through the individual characters in this string. |
| GetHashCode() | It returns the hash code for this string. |
| GetType() | It is used to get the Type of the current instance. |
| GetTypeCode() | It is used to return the TypeCode for class String. |
| IndexOf(String) | It is used to report the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the specified string in this instance. |
| Insert(Int32, String) | It is used to return a new string in which a specified string is inserted at a specified index position. |
| Intern(String) | It is used to retrieve the system's reference to the specified String. |
| IsInterned(String) | It is used to retrieve a reference to a specified String. |
| IsNormalized() | It is used to indicate that this string is in Unicode normalization form C. |
| IsNullOrEmpty(String) | It is used to indicate that the specified string is null or an Empty string. |
| IsNullOrWhiteSpace(String) | It is used to indicate whether a specified string is null, empty, or consists only of white-space characters. |
| Join(String, String[]) | It is used to concatenate all the elements of a string array, using the specified separator between each element. |
| LastIndexOf(Char) | It is used to report the zero-based index position of the last occurrence of a specified character within String. |
| LastIndexOfAny(Char[]) | It is used to report the zero-based index position of the last occurrence in this instance of one or more characters specified in a Unicode array. |
| Normalize() | It is used to return a new string whose textual value is the same as this string, but whose binary representation is in Unicode normalization form C. |
| PadLeft(Int32) | It is used to return a new string that right-aligns the characters in this instance by padding them with spaces on the left. |
| PadRight(Int32) | It is used to return a new string that left-aligns the characters in this string by padding them with spaces on the right. |
| Remove(Int32) | It is used to return a new string in which all the characters in the current instance, beginning at a specified position and continuing through the last position, have been deleted. |
| Replace(String, String) | It is used to return a new string in which all occurrences of a specified string in the current instance are replaced with another specified string. |
| Split(Char[]) | It is used to split a string into substrings that are based on the characters in an array. |
| StartsWith(String) | It is used to check whether the beginning of this string instance matches the specified string. |
| Substring(Int32) | It is used to retrieve a substring from this instance. The substring starts at a specified character position and continues to the end of the string. |
| ToCharArray() | It is used to copy the characters in this instance to a Unicode character array. |
| ToLower() | It is used to convert String into lowercase. |
| ToLowerInvariant() | It is used to return convert String into lowercase using the casing rules of the invariant culture. |
| ToString() | It is used to return instance of String. |
| ToUpper() | It is used to convert String into uppercase. |
| Trim() | It is used to remove all leading and trailing white-space characters from the current String object. |
| TrimEnd(Char[]) | It Is used to remove all trailing occurrences of a set of characters specified in an array from the current String object. |
| TrimStart(Char[]) | It is used to remove all leading occurrences of a set of characters specified in an array from the current String object. |
