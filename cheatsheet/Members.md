### Field

Fields are **variables declared at class scope** A field may be a built-in numeric type or an instance of another class.A field is a variable of any type that is declared directly in a **class** or **struct**. Fields are members of their containing type.A class or struct may have instance fields or static fields or both. Instance fields are specific to an instance of a type. If you have a class T, with an instance field F, you can create two objects of type T, and modify the value of F in each object without affecting the value in the other object. By contrast, a static field belongs to the class itself, and is shared among all instances of that class. Changes made from instance A will be visibly immediately to instances B and C if they access the field. eg:

```csharp
// private field
private DateTime date;

// public field (Generally not recommended.)
public string day;
```
