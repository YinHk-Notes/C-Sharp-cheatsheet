## Access modifiers
**Access modifiers** are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or a type. This section introduces the four access modifiers:

- `public`
- `protected
- `internal`
- `private`


|Modifier|Description|
|-|-|
|public|	The code is accessible for all classes|
|private|The code is only accessible within the same class|
|protected|	The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class. You will learn more about inheritance in a later chapter|
|internal|	The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly. You will learn more about this in a later chapter|
